Node.js setup 

step-1 
open the terminal and enter syntax :

npm init 

step-2 
create a file with extenstion of .js 

server.js

step-3 
install the required package by using the npm 
(Node Package Manager)
npm install express,
npm install mongoose,
npm install nodemon ,
npm install cors,


step-4 
goto package.json file change some scripts changes 

"scripts": {
    "start":"node server.js",
    "server":"nodemon server",
}

step-5
connect the server  with port number 3000

app.listen(3000,()=>console.log("Server running .....!"))

step-6 
check the server is connected or not'connected 

npm run server

step-8 
connect the databse (mongoose) (About mongodb setup explanation in below)

mongoose.connect('mongodb+srv://srinureddy:srinureddy@cluster0.nwxf3wp.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority',{
})
.then( ()=> console.log('dB connected ...!')
).catch(err =>console.log(err))

check the datadase is connected or not'connected 
npm run server

output:
	Server running .....!
	dB connected ...!

step-9

Now Start the CRUD operations 

Before starting create a file model.js
In this model.js file we will write Schema

(A mongoose schema defines the shape of documents
 inside a particular collection)
and export module  

get,post,delete,update 

example:GET 
app.get('/allusers' ,async(req,res)=>{
    try{
        let allusers=await devuser.find();
        return res.json(allusers);

    }
    catch(err){
        console.log(err);
        return res.status(500).send('server error')
       }
})

step-10 
By using Postman API Platform

check your API's working condition 
EX:
POST,GET,DELETE,UPDATE

Now comming to frontend setup 

step-1
In same terminal 

npx create-react-app (appname) 
the appname is 'user'
syantax:
npx create-react-app user 

step-2 
After createing react app 
Open new terminal 
cd user 
Befor 
PS D:\authentication_login> 

PS D:\authentication_login> cd user
After 
PS D:\authentication_login\user>  

check the react app is working or not
 
npm start
 
output:
react logo will display on UI 

step-3 
Install some librarys in react-app
npm install react-router-dom
npm install axios 

What is axios :Axios is a library that serves to create HTTP requests
that are present externally.

SetUp route path  in app.js file

by this setup import BrowerRouter,Route,Routes

step-4 
In src folder 
i am creating Allbrands.js and Brand.js files 

The Allbrands.js file is using to display all brands data in UI page 
In the Allbrands.js file  import one library called axios 
&
The Brand.js file is using to update the  brands will 
stored on mongodb database.

In the Brand.js file  import one library called axios 


step-5 
import the Allbrands,Brand files in  app.js file 

and Set the route path 

step-6
Now run the server and react-app in different terminals 

By running the server npm run server

By running the react npm start
